        <h1>James Webb Space Telescope Discovers Most Distant Galaxy Ever Observed</h1>
        <h2>Galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 existed just 290 million years after the Big Bang</h2>
        <p class="date">August 7, 2025</p>
        <p class="intro">
            In a groundbreaking discovery, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has detected the most distant galaxy ever observed, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic horizon. The galaxy, named JADES-GS-z14-0, is seen as it existed just 290 million years after the Big Bang, making it the most distant galaxy confirmed to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discovery was made as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program, which is systematically studying the early universe. What makes this finding particularly remarkable is that the galaxy is unexpectedly bright and massive for its young age, challenging current theories about how quickly the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang.

        <blockquote>
            "This discovery pushes our understanding of galaxy formation to earlier times than we had previously thought possible. We're seeing this galaxy as it was when the universe was just 2% of its current age."

        <p>
            The galaxy's light has traveled approximately 13.5 billion years to reach us, stretched by the expansion of the universe into infrared wavelengths that the James Webb Space Telescope was specifically designed to detect. Analysis of the light spectrum revealed the presence of hydrogen and oxygen, indicating that star formation was already well underway in this galaxy when the universe was still in its infancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientists estimate that JADES-GS-z14-0 is several hundred million times the mass of our Sun, with new stars forming at a rate about 20 times that of our Milky Way galaxy. This challenges existing models of galaxy formation, which didn't predict such large, bright galaxies existing so early in cosmic history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discovery was made possible by JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), which can break down light into its component wavelengths. This allows astronomers to measure the galaxy's redshift, a measure of how much the light has been stretched by the expansion of the universe, and thus determine its distance and age.
        </p>
        <p>
            The research team plans to continue observing JADES-GS-z14-0 to learn more about its properties and what it can tell us about the earliest epochs of galaxy formation. The findings have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal for publication.
